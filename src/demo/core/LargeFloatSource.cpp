Description:
	This code exercises the Proxy Re-Encryption capabilities of the NJIT Lattice crypto library.
	In this code we:
		- Generate a key pair.
		- Encrypt a string of data.
		- Decrypt the data.
		- Generate a new key pair.
		- Generate a proxy re-encryption key.
		- Re-Encrypt the encrypted data.
		- Decrypt the re-encrypted data.
	We configured parameters (namely the ring dimension and ciphertext modulus) to provide a level of security roughly equivalent to a root hermite factor of 1.007 which is generally considered secure and conservatively comparable to AES-128 in terms of computational work factor and may be closer to AES-256.
